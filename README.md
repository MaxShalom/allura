# Allura
Website for Allura Imports Inc. 

**[View Site](https://allurasite.firebaseapp.com/)**


This website was built using many web technologies include the [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) front-end frameworks. Currently, I'm using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host at [https://allura.netlify.com/](https://allura.netlify.com/), which will be moved to replace https://alluraimports.com in the coming future.

For the contact form, I'm using [Formcarry](https://formcarry.com/) and for email newsletters, I'm using [CleverReach](https://www.cleverreach.com/en/).
